# Your First Program

Start a KCoral server, then submit a program that adds one to a four-element
tensor on its GPU (graphics processing unit) and returns the result.

## Required hardware

You need one Linux machine with an NVIDIA GPU and a compatible driver. Install
the [GPU server environment](installation.md#gpu-server) on it; this
also installs the client. The example uses PyTorch, a tensor library included
in that environment, and does not compile a custom kernel.

The steps below run the server and client on that same machine, in two
terminals. A CPU (central processing unit) compilation server cannot run this
program: the uploaded function checks that the tensor is on a GPU before
doing arithmetic.

## Launch the server

In the first terminal, open the repository directory, activate the installed
environment, and start one worker on GPU 0:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
kcoral server --device gpu --gpus 0 --workers-per-gpu 1 --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

GPU 0 is the first GPU listed by `nvidia-smi`. Wait for server startup to finish
and leave this terminal running. The client will connect to
`http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Submit the program

In a second terminal, open the same repository directory and activate the
environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Save the following complete program as `first_program.py`:

```{literalinclude} ../../examples/first_program.py
:language: python
```

You can also {download}`download first_program.py <../../examples/first_program.py>`.
Run it from the directory where you saved it:

```bash
KCORAL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 python first_program.py
```

Expected output:

```text
COMPLETED
[1. 2. 3. 4.]
```

The program checks that the request completed and that the returned array has
the expected values. When you finish, press `Ctrl+C` in the server terminal to
stop it.

### Use a remote server

To submit from another machine, start the server with `--host 0.0.0.0` so it
listens beyond the local machine. Install the
[client](installation.md#install-the-client) on the submitting machine, save the same
program there, and set `KCORAL_URL` to the server's reachable address, for
example `http://192.168.1.10:8000`. The client machine does not need a GPU.
See [Launch the server](../server-guide/launch-the-server.md) for more configuration.

## How it works

1. `Program.upload(kind="module")` sends the source defining `add_one`.
2. `Program.get_function()` selects that function from the uploaded module.
3. The tensor upload transfers the NumPy input to the server's GPU.
4. `Program.run()` performs the addition on that GPU and binds the result to `y`.
5. `Program.return_()` selects the output for the response. The client decodes it
   as a CPU NumPy array and checks the values.

The example also checks `result.completed` before reading the output. Instruction
failures are returned as data in `result.error`; connection failures and request
errors raise the exceptions documented in the {ref}`Python API <python-errors>`.

Continue to [Write a client program](../client-guide/writing-a-program.md) for the builder methods and
request lifecycle, or [Benchmark a Kernel with KCoral](../tutorials/benchmark-kernel.md)
to compile a custom kernel, check correctness and measure its execution.
